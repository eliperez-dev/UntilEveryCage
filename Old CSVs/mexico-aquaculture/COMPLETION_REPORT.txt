IMPORTANT NOTES
===============================================================================

LIMITATIONS:
  - Dataset contains ONLY aquaculture, fishing, and agricultural services
  - Does NOT include: slaughterhouses, processing plants, research labs
  - Data source: DENUE (official registered businesses only)
  - Limited contact information available (no emails recorded)

DATA QUALITY:
  - All coordinates are valid and verified
  - Phone numbers incomplete but valid when present
  - Activity names preserved in Spanish
  - Full state/municipality coverage

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
  - Add slaughterhouses via SENASICA data
  - Add research facilities via COFEPRIS data
  - Add breeding facilities via SEMARNAT data
  - Implement Spanish language UI support

===============================================================================
NEXT STEPS
===============================================================================

1. BUILD & DEPLOY BACKEND:
   cd /path/to/project
   cargo shuttle run

2. TEST API:
   GET http://localhost:8000/api/locations?country_code=mx
   Expected: 23,996 facilities returned

3. VERIFY ON MAP:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:8000
   - Use country/state filters
   - Verify Mexican facilities appear
   - Check coordinates and facility types

4. OPTIONAL FRONTEND UPDATES:
   - Add Mexican states to state selector (constants.js)
   - Add Spanish language support
   - Test state-level filtering

5. PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT:
   - Rebuild with `cargo shuttle run`
   - Deploy to Shuttle platform
   - Verify API endpoint in production
